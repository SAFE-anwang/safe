## SAFE Coin Distribution Instructions  ([中文版本](https://github.com/SAFE-anwang/safe/blob/master/safe-docs/safe-distribution-cn.md))


### 1. Initial allocation of SAFE  

(1) Total supply: 29.4 million, the actual number of SAFE will be less. For instance, no super blocks will be produced from May 2021 to September 2021.  

(2) 2.72% allocated to the original DASH holders, approximately 800,000. This portion is considered candy and can be acquired by DASH users.  

(3) 36.73% allocated for mining incentives, roughly 10.8 million (45% for miners, 45% for masternodes, and 10% for proposal incentives). About 2.25 million have been produced in December 2021, meaning there are still 8.55 million SAFE not yet produced.  

(4) 13.60% allocated to the team, about 4 million coins. This portion was locked in September 2018, and most of the locked tokens have been unlocked after 3-4 years. However, the SAFE team re-locked the tokens in July 2021. Release rules: the first 500,000 coins will be released after 12 months, and every subsequent 500,000 coins will be released every six months thereafter for 5 years.  

(5) 20.41% allocated for marketing, approximately 6 million SAFEs. This portion has been used up.  

(6) 26.53% was used to exchange Anwang2 and VoteChain ELT users into SAFE, about 7.8 million coins. This process was completed in January 2019. The SAFE team's Anwang2 and ELT exchanged for nearly 2 million SAFE. After 3-4 years of team expenses, the remaining 500,000 coins were locked together with the tokens in Part 4.  


### 2. Status of SAFE
As of April 6, 2023, the status of SAFE is as follows:  

(1) The total supply of SAFE is 29.4 million.  

(2) Unmined, 7.85 million.  

(3) Team lock-up, 3.4 million coins. SAFE official lock-up address: [XmVvAye4ph9s3M5AjrWDRFAzTKrkpwcHHR](https://chain.anwang.com/address/XmVvAye4ph9s3M5AjrWDRFAzTKrkpwcHHR). This portion releases 500,000 SAFEs every half-year for team development and marketing.  

(4) Other lock-up, 9.80 million. View at [https://chain.anwang.com/rankings](https://chain.anwang.com/rankings). There are already 13.2 million locked, minus the 3.4 million locked by the team.  

(5) Real circulation, 8.34 million. Subtract the amounts from the above three parts from 29.4 million to get 7.05 million.  

Approximately 4,300 SAFEs [contract on ETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xEE9c1Ea4DCF0AAf4Ff2D78B6fF83AA69797B65Eb) have been cross-chain linked to ETH, and approximately 1.02 million SAFEs [contract on BSC](https://bscscan.com/token/0x4d7fa587ec8e50bd0e9cd837cb4da796f47218a1) have been cross-chain linked to BSC.
